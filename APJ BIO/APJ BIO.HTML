    <p>On 10 June 2002, the National Democratic Alliance which was in power at the time, expressed its intention to nominate Kalam for the post of the President of India.[40][41] His candidature was backed by the opposition parties including the Samajwadi Party and the Nationalist Congress Party.[42][43] After the support for Kalam, incumbent president K. R. Narayanan chose not to seek a re-election.[44] Kalam said of the announcement of his candidature:

        I am really overwhelmed. Everywhere both in Internet and in other media, I have been asked for a message. I was thinking what message I can give to the people of the country at this juncture.[45]</p>

    <p>During his term as president, he was affectionately known as the "People's President".[52][53][54][55] He later stated that signing the Office of profit bill was the toughest decision he had taken during his tenure.[56][57][58] In September 2003, during an interactive session at PGIMR in Chandigarh, Kalam asserted the need of Uniform Civil Code in India, keeping in view the population of the country.[59][60] He also took a decision to impose President's rule in Bihar in 2005.[61] However, during his tenure as president, he made no decision on 20 out of the 21 mercy petitions submitted to him to commute death penalties, including that of terrorist Afzal Guru, who was convicted of conspiracy in the December 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament and was sentenced to death by the Supreme Court of India in 2004.[62] He acted only on a single plea, rejecting that of Dhananjoy Chatterjee, who was later hanged.[63]</p>
